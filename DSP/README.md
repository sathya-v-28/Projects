## About
This Image-Fusion Project was done as a part of Digital Signal Processing Lab (19ECE284) course in 2024. The project implements three image fusion 
techniques—Simple Averaging, Pyramid Fusion, and Wavelet Fusion—to combine image pairs and evaluate the quality of fusion using SSIM (Structural Similarity Index) 
and SIFT-based keypoint matching. The results are saved and visualized to compare the effectiveness of each method.

## Consists of code in 2 parts: 
Part 1 (Synthetic Blurring) : Can be used to generate blurred images for testing in case the user does not have suitable images. 
Part 2 (Image Fusion) : Fuses images using three different methods - Simple Averaging, Pyramid, Wavelet and saves results. Evaluated using SSIM and SIFT.
